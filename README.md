# Thesis_code

This is the code used for my master's thesis, where an extendable version of Adaptive Cross Approximation was used to speed up the clustering of a growing amount of time series.
This implementation is an extension on the code given by Mathias Pede [2], which was published alongside [3]. In the experiments, the time series of the UCR archive were used [1].

#### Create a first ACA approximation
To create an ACA approximation, use the following code:

    from src.extendable_aca import ACA
    cp = ClusterProblem(starting_series, "dtw", compare_args={"window": len(series) - 1}, solved_matrix=None)
    ACA_approximation = ACA(cp, tolerance=0.05, max_rank=rank)
    
#### Extending previous ACA approximations
This ACA approximation can be extended using:

    ACA_approximation.extend(new_series, method=method)

As input for the 'method' parameter, the options are:
- For the skeleton update: "method1" or "skeleton update".
- For the tolerance-based update: "method2" or "tolerance-based update".
- For the adaptive update: "method3" or "adaptive update".
- For the exact update: "method4"  or "exact update".
- For the maximal update :"method5"  or"maximal update".

#### Get the current ACA approximation:
Use the following function:

    ACA_approximation.getApproximation()
